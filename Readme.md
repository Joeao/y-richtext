# OpenPaas Collaborative Edition

This tool is a collaborative text editor that doesn't need any server (except a web server). The text editor uses Yjs(<https://dadamonad.github.io/>) as a frontend for WebRTC.

## Configuration
First clone the directory using git, then serve it using any web server (Apache, nginx). It is also recommended to run a socket.io server for webrtc signaling, for example <https://github.com/andyet/signalmaster>.
